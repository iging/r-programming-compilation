# R Programming Activity - SIA102

This repository contains R scripts that solve the problems outlined in the SIA102 programming activity. The problems involve using loops and vector operations to perform calculations.

## Problem 1: Calculations using `repeat` loop

Write an R program that uses a `repeat` loop to compute the following from 1 to 15 (where applicable):

- **a) Product of numbers from 1 to 5:** Calculate the product of integers from 1 to 5.
- **b) Average of numbers from 1 to 15:** Calculate the average of integers from 1 to 15.
- **c) Square of numbers from 1 to 5:** Calculate the square of each integer from 1 to 5.
- **d) Square root of numbers from 1 to 10:** Calculate the square root of each integer from 1 to 10.

## Problem 2: Vector Operations using Loops

Given the vector `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, write an R program that uses any looping command to perform the following:

- **a) Average of all elements:** Calculate the average of all elements in the vector.
- **b) Sum of each element to loop count:** Calculate the sum of each element added to the loop counter (e.g., the first element + 1, the second element + 2, etc.).
- **c) Product of each element to loop count:** Calculate the product of each element multiplied by the loop counter.
- **d) Vector of odd numbers:** Create a new vector containing only the odd numbers from the original vector.
- **e) Sum of all even numbers:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers in the original vector.

## How to Run the Code

This R code can be executed in the following environments:

1.  **RStudio:** RStudio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, running, and debugging R code. Download and install RStudio from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2.  **Online R Compilers:** Several online R compilers are available on the internet. These allow you to run R code directly in your web browser without installing any software. Search for "online R compiler" to find a suitable one.

**To run the code:**

1.  Save the R code as an `.R` file (e.g., `sia102_activity.R`).
2.  **In RStudio:** Open the file in RStudio and click the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut (usually Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter).
3.  **In an online compiler:** Copy and paste the code into the compiler's editor and click the "Run" or equivalent button.

The output should be displayed in the console or output area.
