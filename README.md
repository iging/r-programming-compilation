## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1. **Install R**:

   - Download and install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/)

2. **Install RStudio**:

   - Download and install RStudio Desktop from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akosikhada/R-programming-compilation.git
   cd R-programming-compilation
   ```

## üîç Usage

Each activity folder contains R scripts that can be executed in RStudio:

1. **Open the script in RStudio**:

   - Navigate to the activity folder
   - Open the desired .r file

2. **Run the script**:

   - Use the `source()` function: `source("filename.r")`
   - Alternatively, select and run code sections using the Run button or Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac)

3. **Follow prompts**:
   - Some scripts require user input. Follow the prompts in the console
