# R Programming Laboratory Activity/Examination - SIA102

This repository contains the R script(s) used to solve the problem of categorizing and analyzing a set of 10 numbers entered one at a time.

## Description

This script takes 10 numbers as input, one at a time, and determines how many of them are:

- Negative
- Zero
- Positive
- Even
- Odd

It also calculates and displays:

- The sum of all positive numbers
- The product of all negative numbers

## Files

- `main.R`: This R script implements the solution.
- `README.md`: This file (the current file) provides an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1.  **This script is designed to be run within RStudio.** Open RStudio.
2.  Set the working directory to the location of the script.
3.  Run the script using the `source()` function: `source("main.R")`

The script will then prompt you to enter 10 numbers, one at a time.

## Problem Description

Write an R script that processes 10 numbers entered by the user, one at a time. For each number entered, the script should:

1.  Categorize the number as negative, zero, or positive.
2.  Categorize the number as even or odd.

After all 10 numbers have been entered, the script should display the following:

1.  The total count of negative numbers.
2.  The total count of zeros.
3.  The total count of positive numbers.
4.  The total count of even numbers.
5.  The total count of odd numbers.
6.  The sum of all positive numbers.
7.  The product of all negative numbers. (Note: The product of no numbers is typically considered to be 1.)
